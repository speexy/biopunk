Climate change, the loss of biodiversity, chances and risks of new technologies & digitization, health & food, equality - for all these the understanding of living systems and their interaction with our surroundings become more and more important.\n\nHence, our answer is to design a place that offers an interactive environment and supports creativity & collaboration for actively framing a sustainable future within a bio-based society. We upgraded our [machBar-Potsdam](https://machbar-potsdam.de/) (fabLab) in Oct. 2018 with open bio-lab facilities to cultivate organisms and grow own biological raw material, design bio-based ideas and build prototypes.\n\nOur DIY bio-facilities @machBar are embedded in the community of a self-governed cultural center; [freiLand-Potsdam](https://www.freiland-potsdam.de/#). Here more than 50 stakeholder are acting on an areal of 12 000 square meters and 5 buildings, whose mission it is to empower young people to actively create a sustainable future.\n\nThe NGO Science Shop Potsdam funded the machBar Potsdam fabLab in 2012 @freiLand and is since the legally responsible entity. In addition the Science Shop acts as a local network HUB for the freiLand community to regional partners in academia, tech, arts & economy (SME) as well as global networks for open science, open education & open innovation. Within a research project to regional strategies for bio-based economy ([DiReBio](https://direbio.de/)) funded by the German Ministry for Education and Science (BMBF), the Science Shop Potsdam is partner with the University Potsdam and Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy. Here we utilize the bio-lab facilities to include kids and young people in a future designing session for a regional bio-based economy.\n\nFollow us","link":{"label":"Newsletter","url":"http://eepurl.com/dJvaA6","button":true},"color":"darkBlue"}]},"html":""}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
